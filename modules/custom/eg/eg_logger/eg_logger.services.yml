# The eg_logger.logger.mail_logger service at first seems to be irrelevant to
# the eg_logger.logger.channel.eg_logger. However, since it is tagged with 'logger'
# it is actually registered as a specific service that another service (called
# collector) looks for. In this case, the collector is LoggingChannelFactory.
